## Task 1

Task1.sql - This SQL query was created in BigQuery. I loaded the data in BigQuery to test the data. Both the dates are inclusive and the query is giving desired result.

To Optimise the query: 
1. We must check the indexing.
2. Data distribution and paritioning.


## Task 2

Task 2 has been done in 2 ways. 

### Task2.java

I am working with Java SparkSQL on a day to day basis so I am more comfortable converting the code to this. I did not run the code as their was some issue with compiler in my system. I have broken it down in diffeent Datasets for better readability and understanding.


### Task2.py

I have tried to write the code in Python but as I am not very conversant with it I have taken help from Google and I am not sure if the implementation of lambda function is 100% correct.
